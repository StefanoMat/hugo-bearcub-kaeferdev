This is my website. I created it to store and publish content that I find interesting and relevant to my software engineering career. I’ll be covering various topics, including personal aspects of my life that influence my professional journey. Here, I don’t have to adhere to LinkedIn or any other social media standards, allowing me to freely express what matters to me.

If you want to get in touch, send me an {{< emailto>}} or a message on {{< newtab "https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanokaefer/" >}}LinkedIn{{< /newtab >}}.
